    						<i>The Greatest Meeting</i> 
							This is the saga of the impassioned journeys of two 
							men, their true premonitions of a mystical meeting, 
							and their self-discoveries. Full of compelling 
							adventure, love and betrayal, joy and sadness, their 
							stories have never before been told. This 
							extraordinary true historical novel takes place in 
							Central Asia, and the Middle East; toady's Turkey 
							in the thirteenth century during the tumultuous time 
							of Changiz Khan's conquest. It is an unforgettable 
							detailed narrative account of the lives of an 
							enigmatic giant and legendary mystic figure, 
							Shams-e Tabrizi, and the most renowned religious 
							scholar, Molana Jalaleddin Mohammad-e Rumi. It 
							chronicles the relentless search of a critical and 
							progressive thinker, Shams, to find a true friend, 
							a soul mate, who could give a powerful echo to his 
							voice, to his revolutionary ideas of interpreting 
							religion relevant to our daily earthly existence, 
							of recognizing each human being as the "Supreme 
							Majesty." This remarkable literary work presents the 
							story of Rumi's dream for the ultimate divine 
							illumination, his yearning for something greater 
							than himself, his intellectual rebirth, and the 
							volcanic artistic eruption that resulted in the 
							incomparable monumental works of poetry: The 
							Collection of Shams-e Tabrizi and Massnavi; 
							comprised of over seventy thousand verses. For over 
							seven centuries, over seventy thousand of Rumi's 
							ingenious and magnificent poems have profoundly 
							taught us all a greater level of self-awareness, 
							and now this work acquaints us with the life of this 
							man, and the enigmatic person who inspired him. An 
							impressive artistic undertaking, lyrical, intelligent, 
							beautifully crafted, paced, this work is enriched by 
							unforgettable characters. From the early chapters to 
							the heartwarming, triumphant, unpredictable 
							and astonishing conclusion, Majid Amini, the author 
							of Escape From Paradise, proves himself a masterful 
							writer. For those who appreciate Rumi's poems 
							and for those unfamiliar with his work, this book is 
							a must read.

							relationship. It is a touching tale of love and 
							betrayal, full of daring exploits, childhood pranks 
							and the sweet and bitter pain of growing up.

    						<i>Escape From Paradise</i> -- the long-awaited novel about 
    						the 1979 Iranian Revolution -- is heartfelt, 
    						powerful, and compulsively readable. The lives of a 
    						group of Iranians and a young American woman with 
    						her two children are seriously threatened in the 
    						devastating aftermath of the bloody Iran revolution 
    						of 1979. Combined, their lives make a tapestry that 
    						reflects the entire colorful canvas of society's 
    						different political persuasions and social classes. 
    						For reasons of their own, each is blacklisted and 
    						cannot leave the country through the normal means. 
    						Unbeknownst to each other, they individually employ 
    						the services of an underground smuggling ring, run 
    						by a profiteer of the revolution, to guide them 
    						across the Iran-Turkish border. Each person has a 
    						different fascinating story, a distinct and 
    						astonishing reason for embarking upon such a 
    						dangerous journey, a journey that encompasses their 
    						past -- bygone days that led them to the shocking 
    						reality of the present. It is during these 
    						flashbacks that their unforgettable stories 
    						masterfully unfold and the process of reevaluating 
    						their pasts are lyrically narrated. Told with 
    						compassion, this is the story of a group of people 
    						who, under the most adverse of circumstances, are 
    						forced to resort to their common humanity in order 
    						to discover the truth that they hope will ultimately 
    						set them free. This novel presents the reader with 
    						an unparalleled opportunity to experience not only 
    						the self-defeating, heartbreaking political 
    						struggles of Iranians during the last century, but 
    						also their resiliency. More importantly, it captures 
    						the soul of Iran -- its enchanting culture and 
    						wonderful, colorful and hospitable citizens. Majid 
    						Amini is a skillful storyteller, a writer who 
    						portrays the anguished truth of the human heart and 
    						the triumph of the human spirit during the brutality 
    						of the bloody revolution in the richly lyrical prose
    						and unforgettable narratives.
